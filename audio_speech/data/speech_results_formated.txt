WITH GEL SO MOVES ME MY BREATH CATCHES VAMP SIREN SEDUCTRESS HOW MUCH MORE SHE REVEALS IN HER GLARE OF INK THAN SHE KNOWS HOW SHE INCARNATES OUR DESPERATE HUMAN NEED FOR REGARD OUR PASSION TO LIVE IN BEAUTY TO BE BEAUTY TO BE CHERISHED BY GLANCES IF BY NO MORE OF SOMETHING LIKE LOVE OR LOVE THANK YOU
