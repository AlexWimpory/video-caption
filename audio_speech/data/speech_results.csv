SheenaIyengar_2010G-480p,1005.0,TODAY I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AROUND THE WORLD AND EIGHTEEN MINUTES MY BASE OF OPERATIONS IS IN THE US BUT LET'S START AT THE OTHER END OF THE MAP IN KYOTO JAPAN WHERE I WAS LIVING WITH THE JAPANESE FAMILY WHILE I WAS DOING PART OF MY DISSERTATION OR RESEARCH FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I KNEW EVEN THEN THAT I WOULD ENCOUNTER CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS THEY POPPED UP WHEN I LEAST EXPECT IT IT ON MY FIRST DAY I WENT TO A RESTAURANT AND I ORDERED A CUP OF GREEN TEA WITH SUGAR AFTER A PAUSE THE WAITER SAID WHEN DOES NOT PUT SUGAR IN GREEN TEA I KNOW I SAID I'M AWARE OF THIS SOME BUT I REALLY LIKE MY TOO SWEET IN RESPONSE HE GAVE ME AN EVEN MORE COURTEOUS VERSION OF THE SAME EXPLANATION ONE DOES NOT PUT SUGAR IN GREEN TEA I UNDERSTAND I SAID THAT THE JAPANESE DO NOT PUT SUGAR IN THEIR GREEN TEA BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT SUGAR IN MIND GREEN TEA SURPRISED BY MY INSISTENCE THE WAITER HAD TO WE TOOK UP THE ISSUE WITH THE MANAGER PRETTY SOON A LENGTHY DISCUSSION ENSUED AND FINALLY THE MANAGER CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID I'M VERY SORRY WE DO NOT HAVE SUGAR WELL SINCE I COULDN'T HAVE MY TEA THE WAY I WANTED IT I ORDERED A CUP OF COFFEE WHICH THE WAITER BROUGHT BROUGHT OVER PROMPTLY RESTING ON THE SAUCER WERE TWO PACKETS OF SUGAR MY FAILURE TO PROCURE OF MYSELF A CUP OF SWEET GREEN TEA WAS NOT DUE TO A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING THIS WAS DUE TO A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN OUR IDEAS ABOUT CHOICE FOR MY AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE WHEN A PAYING CUSTOMER MAKES A REASONABLE REQUEST BASED ON HER PREFERENCES SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO HAVE THAT REQUEST MET THE AMERICAN WAY TO QUOTE BURGER KING IS TO HAVE IT YOUR WAY BECAUSE HIS STARBUCKS SAYS HAPPINESS IS IN YOUR CHOICES BUT FROM THE JAPANESE PERSPECTIVE IT'S THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER IN THIS CASE THE ANGER ENGAGE IN FOR MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE LET'S FACE IT THE WAY I WANTED MY T WAS INAPPROPRIATE ACCORDING TO CULTURAL STANDARDS AND THEY WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP ME SAY FACE AMERICANS TEND TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE REACHED SOME SORT OF PINNACLE IN THE WAY THEY PRACTICE CHOICE THEY THINK THE CHOICE AS SEEN THROUGH THE AMERICAN LENS BEST FULFILLS AND IN NEED TO UNIVERSAL DESIRE FOR CHOICE IN ALL HUMANS UNFORTUNATELY THESE BELIEFS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT DON'T ALWAYS HOLD TRUE IN MANY COUNTRIES IN MANY CULTURES AT TIMES THEY DON'T EVEN HOLD TRUE IN AMERICA'S OWN BORDERS I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS SOME OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AS I DO SO I HOPE HE'LL START THINKING ABOUT SOME OF YOUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS AND HOW THEY WERE SHAPED BY YOU OR BACKGROUNDS FIRST ASSUMPTION IF A CHOICE AFFECTS YOU MEAN YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO MAKE IT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PREFERENCES AND INTERESTS WILL BE MOST FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN AMERICA THE PRIMARY LOCUS OF CHOICE IS THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE MUST CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES SOMETIMES STICKING TO THEIR GUNS REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO RECOMMEND IT'S CALLED BEING TRUE TO YOURSELF BUT DO ALL INDIVIDUALS BENEFIT FROM TAKING SUCH AN APPROACH TO CHOICE MARK LIPPER AND I DID A SERIES OF STUDIES IN WHICH WE SOUGHT THE ANSWER TO THIS VERY QUESTION IN ONE STUDY WHICH WE RAN IN JAPAN TOWN SAN FRANCISCO WE BROUGHT SEVEN TO NINE YEAR OLD ANGLE AND ASIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN INTO THE LABORATORY AND WE DIVIDED UP INTO THREE GROUPS THE FIRST GROUP CAME IN AND THEY WERE GREETED BY MISS SMITH WHO SHOWED THEM SIX FEET PILES OF ANAGRAM PUZZLES THE KIDS GOT TO CHOOSE WHICH PILE OF AND GRAMS THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO AND THEY EVEN GET TO CHOOSE WHICH MARKET WHERE THEY WOULD WRITE THEIR ANSWERS WITH WHEN THE SECOND GROUP OF CHILDREN CAME IN THERE WERE BROUGHT TO THE SAME ROOM SHOWN THE SAME ON A GRAMS BUT THIS TIME MR TOLD THEM WHICH AND AND GRAMS TO DO AND WHICH MARKERS TO WRITE THEIR ANSWER AS WELL NOW WHEN THE THIRD GROUP CAME IN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR ANNA GRAMS AND THEIR MARKERS HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY THEIR MOTHERS IN REALITY THE KIDS WHO WERE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHETHER RIGHT MISS SMITH FOR THEIR MOTHERS WERE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE VERY SAME ACTIVITY WHICH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE FIRST GROUP AND FREELY CHOSEN WITH THIS PROCEDURE WE WERE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE KIDS ACROSS THE THREE GROUPS ALL DID THE SAME ACTIVITY MAKING IT EASIER FOR US TO COMPARE PERFORMANCE SUCH SMALL DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY WE ADMINISTERED THE ACTIVITY YIELDED STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN HOW WILL THEY PERFORMED ANGLO AMERICANS THEY DID TWO AND A HALF TIMES MORE AND GRAMS WHEN THEY GOT TO CHOOSE THEM AS COMPARED TO WHEN IT WAS CHOSEN FOR THEM BY MISS SMITH FOR THEIR MOTHERS IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO DID THE CHOOSING IF THE TASK WAS DICTATED BY ANOTHER THEIR PERFORMANCE SUFFERED IN FACT SOME OF THE KIDS WERE VISIBLY EMBARRASSED WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR MOTHERS HAD BEEN CONSULTED ONE GIRL NAMED MARY SAID YOU ASKED MY MOTHER IN CONTRAST ASIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN PERFORM BEST WHEN THEY BELIEVE THEIR MOTHERS AND MAKE THE CHOICE SECOND BEST WHEN THEY CHOSE FOR THEMSELVES AND LEAST WELL WHEN IT HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY MISS SMITH A GIRL NAMED NOT SUE ME EVEN APPROACHED MISS SMITH THAT SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM AND TUGGED ON HER SKIRT AND ASKED COULD YOU PLEASE TELL MY MOM HAD DID IT JUST LIKE SHE SAID THE FIRST GENERATION CHILDREN WERE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR IMMIGRANT PARENTS APPROACH TO CHOICE FOR THEN CHOICE WAS NOT JUST A WAY OF DEFINING IN ASSERTING THEIR INDIVIDUALITY BUT A WAY TO CREATE COMMUNITY AND HARMONY BY DEFERRING TO THE CHOICES OF PEOPLE WHOM THEY TRUSTED AND RESPECT THAT IF THEY HAD A CONCEPT OF BEING TRUE TO ONESELF THAN THAT SELF MOST LIKELY COMPOSED NONE OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT HAVE A COLLECTIVE SUCCESS WAS JUST AS MUCH ABOUT PLEASING KEY FIGURES AS IT WAS ABOUT SATISFYING ONE'S OWN PREFERENCES OR YOU COULD SAY THAT THE INDIVIDUALS PREFERENCES WERE SHAPED BY THE PREFERENCES OF SPECIFIC OTHERS THE ASSUMPTION THAN THAT WE DO BEST WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL SELF CHOOSES ONLY HOLDS WIND THAT SELF IS CLEARLY DIVIDED FROM OTHERS WHEN IN CONTRAST TO ARE MORE INDIVIDUALS SEE THEIR CHOICES AND THEIR OUTCOMES IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED THAN THEY MAY AMPLIFY ONE ANOTHER SUCCESS BY TURNING CHOOSING INTO A COLLECTIVE ACT TO INSIST THAT THEY CHOOSE INDEPENDENTLY MIGHT ACTUALLY COMPROMISE BOTH THEIR PERFORMANCE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS GET THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE AMERICAN PARADIGM THE MAN'S IT LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR INJURED DEPENDENTS OR AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL FALLIBILITY IT REQUIRES THAT EVERYONE TREAT CHOICE AS A PRIVATE AND SELF DEFINING ACT PEOPLE THAT HAVE GROWN UP IN SUCH A PARADIGM MIGHT FIND IT MOTIVATING BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT EVERYONE THRIVES UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CHOOSING ALONE THE SECOND ASSUMPTION WHICH INFORMS THE AMERICAN VIEW OF CHOICE GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE WORD CHOICES YOU HAVE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO MAKE THE BEST CHOICE SO BRING IT ON WALMART THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AMAZON WITH TWENTY SEVEN MILLION BUCKS AND MATCH DOT COM WITH WHAT IS IT FIFTEEN MILLION DATE POSSIBILITIES NOW YOU WILL SURELY FIND THE PERFECT MATCH LET'S TEST THIS ASSUMPTION BUT HEADING OVER TO EASTERN EUROPE HERE I INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHO WERE RESIDENTS OF FORMERLY COMMUNIST COUNTRIES WE WILL FACE THE CHALLENGE OF TRANSITIONING TO A MORE DEMOCRATIC AND CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY WHAT DID THE MOST INTERESTING REVELATIONS CAME NOT FROM AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION BUT FROM A SIMPLE GESTURE OF HOSPITALITY WHEN THE PARTICIPANTS ARRIVED FOR THEIR INTERVIEW I OFFERED THEM A SET OF DRINKS COKE DIED COKE SPRITE SEVEN TO BE EXACT DURING THE VERY FIRST SESSION WHICH WAS RUN IN RUSSIA WHAT DID THE PARTICIPANTS MADE A COMMENT THAT REALLY CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD OH BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ALL JUST SODA THAT'S JUST ONE CHOICE I WAS SO STRUCK BY THIS COMMENT THAT FROM THEN ON I STARTED TO OFFER ALL THE PARTICIPANTS THOSE SEVEN SODAS AND I ASK THEM HOW MANY CHOICES ARE THESE AGAIN AND AGAIN THE PERCEIVE THE SEVEN DIFFERENT SODA IS NOT AS SEVEN CHOICES BUT AS ONE CHOICE SODA OR NO SODA WHEN I PUT OUT JUICE AND WATER IN ADDITION TO D SEVEN SUIT IS NOW THEY PERCEIVED IT IS ONLY THREE CHOICES JEWS WATER AND SHOWED IT COMPARE THIS TO THE DIE HARD DEVOTION OF MANY AMERICANS NOT JUST TO A PARTICULAR FLAVOR OF SODA BUT TO A PARTICULAR BRAND RESEARCH SHOWS REPEATEDLY THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COKE AND PEPSI OF COURSE YOU AND I KNOW THAT COKE IS THE BETTER CHOICE FOR MODERN AMERICANS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO MORE OPTIONS AND MORE ADS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD CHOICES JUST AS MUCH ABOUT WHO THEY ARE HARD AS IT IS ABOUT WHAT THE PRODUCT IS COMBINE THIS WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT MORE CHOICES ARE ALWAYS BETTER AND YOU HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM EVERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE MATTERS AND SO EVERY CHOICE MATTERS BUT FOR EASTERN EUROPEANS THE SUDDEN AVAILABILITY OF ALL THESE CONSUMER PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET PLACE WAS A HUGE THEY WERE FLOODED WITH CHOICE BEFORE THEY COULD PROTEST DEBATED NOT SWIM WHEN ASKED WHAT WORDS AND IMAGES DO YOU ASSOCIATE WITH CHOICE GREGORY'S FROM WARSAW SAID FOR ME IT IS FEAR THERE WERE SOME DILEMMA AS YOU SEE I AM USED TO NO CHOICE BOWDEN FROM KIEV SAID IN RESPONSE TO HOW WE FELT ABOUT THE NEW CONSUMER MARKET PLACE IS TOO MUCH WE DO NOT NEED EVERYTHING THAT IS THERE SOCIOLOGISTS FROM THE WARSAW SURVEY AGENCY EXPLAIN THE OLDER GENERATION JUMPED FROM NOTHING TO CHOICE ALL AROUND THEM THEY WERE NEVER GIVEN A CHANCE TO LEARN HOW TO REACT AND TOMAS A YOUNG POLISH MAN SAID I DO NOT NEED TWENTY KINDS OF CHEWING GUM I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I WANT NO CHOICE BUT MANY OF THESE CHOICES ARE QUITE ARTIFICIAL IN REALITY MANY CHOICES ARE BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT THE VALUE OF CHOICE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OPTIONS AMERICANS TRAIN THEIR WHOLE LIVES TO PLAY SPOT THE DIFFERENCE THEY PRACTICE THIS FROM SUCH AN EARLY AGE THAT THEY'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE MUST BE BORN WITH THIS ABILITY IN FACT THE ALL HUMANS SHARE A BASIC NEED AND DESIRE FOR CHOICE WE DON'T ALL SEE CHOICE IN THE SAME PLACES OR TO THE SAME EXTENT WHEN SOMEONE CAN'T SEE HOW ONE CHOICES UNLIKE ANOTHER WELL WHEN THEY WERE TOO MANY CHOICES TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING CAN BE CONFUSING AND FRUSTRATING INSTEAD OF MAKING BETTER CHOICES WOULD BECOME OVERWHELMED BY CHOICE SOMETIMES EVEN AFRAID OF IT CHOICE NO LONGER OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES BUT IMPOSES CONSTRAINTS IT'S NOT A MARKER OF LIBERATION BUT OF SUFFOCATION BY MEANINGLESS MINUTE SHOW IN OTHER WORDS CHOICE CAN DEVELOP INTO THE VERY OPPOSITE OF EVERYTHING IT REPRESENTS IN AMERICA WHEN IT IS THRUST UPON THOSE WHO ARE INSUFFICIENTLY PREPARED FOR IT BUT IT IS NOT ONLY OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER PLACES THAT ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE OF EVER INCREASING CHOICE AMERICANS THEMSELVES ARE DISCOVERING THAT UNLIMITED CHOICE SEEMS MORE ATTRACTIVE AND THEORY THAN IN PRACTICE WE WILL HAVE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL AN EMOTIONAL LIMITATIONS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO PROCESS EVERY SINGLE CHOICE WE ENCOUNTER EVEN IN THE GROCERY STORE AND LET ALONE OVER THE COURSE OF OUR ENTIRE LIVES A NUMBER OF MY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE TEN OR MORE OPTIONS WHEN THEY'RE MAKING A CHOICE THEY MAKE POOR DECISIONS WHETHER IT BE HEALTHCARE INVESTMENT OTHER CRITICAL AREAS IT'S STILL MANY OF US BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE ALL OUR OWN CHOICES AND SEEK OUT EVEN MORE OF THEM THIS BRINGS ME TO THE THIRD AND PERHAPS MOST PROBLEMATIC ASSUMPTION YOU MUST NEVER SAY NO TO CHOICE TO EXAMINE HIS LET'S GO BACK TO THE US AND THEN HOP ACROSS THE POND DE FRANCE RIGHT OUTSIDE CHICAGO A YOUNG COUPLE SUSAN AND DANIEL MITCHELL WERE ABOUT TO HAVE THEIR FIRST BABY THEY DON'T ALREADY PICK OUT A NAME FOR HER BARBARA AFTER HER GRANDMOTHER ONE NIGHT WHEN SUSAN WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT SHE STARTED TO EXPERIENCE CONTRACTIONS AND WAS RUSHED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THE BABY WAS DELIVERED THROUGH A C SECTION WITH BARBARA SUFFERED CEREBRAL AN AXIOM LOSS OF OXYGEN TO THE BRAIN UNABLE TO BREATHE ON HER OWN SHE WAS PUT ON A VENTILATOR TWO DAYS LATER THE DOCTORS GAVE THE MITCHELL'S A CHOICE THEY COULD EITHER REMOVE BARBARA OFF THE LIFE SUPPORT IN WHICH CASE SHE WOULD DIE WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS OR THEY COULD KEEP HER ON LIFE SUPPORT IN WHICH CASE SHE MIGHT STILL DIE WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS IF SHE SURVIVED SHE WOULD REMAIN IN A PERMANENT VEGETATIVE STATE NEVER ABLE TO WALK TALK OR INTERACT WITH OTHERS WHAT DO THEY DO WHAT DO ANY PARENT DO IN A STUDY CONDUCTED WITH SOME KNOWN ABOUT T AND CRISTINA OR FOLLY AMERICAN AND FRENCH PARENTS WERE INTERVIEWED THE HIT ALL SUFFERED THE SAME TRAGEDY IN ALL CASES THE LIFE SUPPORT WAS REMOVED AND THE INFANTS WHO DIED BUT THERE WAS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN FRANCE THE DOCTORS DECIDED WHETHER AND WHEN THE LIFE SUPPORT WOULD BE REMOVED WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES THE FINAL DECISION RESTED WITH THE PARENTS WE WONDERED DOES THIS HAVE AN EFFECT ON HOW THE PARENTS COPE WITH THE LOSS OF THEIR LOVED ONE WE FOUND THAT IT DID EVEN UP TO A YEAR LATER AMERICAN PARENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPRESS NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AS COMPARED TO THEIR FRENCH COUNTERPARTS FRENCH PARENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO SAY THINGS LIKE NO ONE WAS HERE FOR SO LITTLE TIME BUT HE TAUGHT US SO MUCH HE GAVE US A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE AMERICAN PARENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO SAY THINGS LIKE WHAT IF WHAT IF ANOTHER PARENTS COMPLAINED I FEEL AS IF THEY PURPOSELY TORTURED ME I DIDN'T THEY GET NEEDED TO THAT AND ANOTHER PARENTS SAID I FEEL AS IF I'VE PLAYED A ROLE IN AN EXECUTION BUT WHEN THE AMERICAN PARENTS WERE ASKED IF THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE HAD THE DOCTORS MAKE THE DECISION OH SAID NO THEY COULD NOT IMAGINE TURNING THAT CHOICE OVER TO ANOTHER EVEN THOUGH HAVING MADE THAT CHOICE MADE THEM FEEL TRAPPED GUILTY ANGRY THE NUMBER OF CASES THEY WERE EVEN CLINICALLY DEPRESSED THESE PARENTS COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE GIVING UP THE CHOICE BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE GONE CONTRARY TO EVERYTHING THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT AND EVERYTHING THEY HAD COME TO BELIEVE ABOUT THE POWER AND PURPOSE OF CHOICE IN HER ESSAY THE WHITE ALBUM JOAN DIDION RIGHTS WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES IN ORDER TO LIVE WE INTERPRET WHAT WE SEE SELECT THE MOST WORKABLE OF THE MULTIPLE CHOICES WE LIVE ENTIRELY BY THE IMPOSITION OF THE NARRATIVE LINE UPON DISPARATE IMAGES BY THE IDEA WITH WHICH WE LEARN TO FREEZE THE SHIFTING PHANTASMAGORIA WHICH IS OUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE THE STORY AMERICANS TELL THE STORY UPON WHICH THE AMERICAN DREAM DEPENDS IS THE STORY OF LIMITLESS CHOICE THIS NARRATIVE PROMISES SO MUCH FREEDOM HAPPINESS SUCCESS IT LAYS THE WORLD AT YOUR FEET AND SAYS YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING EVERYTHING IT'S A GREAT STORY AND IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THEY WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO REVISE IT BUT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK YOU START TO SEE THE HOLES AND YOU START TO SEE THAT THE STORY CAN BE TOLD AND MANY OTHER WAYS AMERICANS HAVE SO OFTEN TRIED TO DISSEMINATE THEIR IDEAS OF CHOICE BELIEVING THAT THEY WILL BE OR OUGHT TO BE WELCOMED WITH OPEN HEARTS AND MINDS BUT THE HISTORY BOOKS AND THE DAILY NEWS TELL US IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT THAT WAY THE PHANTASMAGORIA THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE THAT WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND ORGANIZE THROUGH NARRATIVE VARIES FROM PLACE TO PLACE NO SINGLE NARRATIVE SERVES THE NEEDS OF EVERYONE EVERYWHERE MOREOVER AMERICANS THEMSELVES COULD BENEFIT FROM INCORPORATING NEW PERSPECTIVES INTO THEIR OWN NARRATIVE WHICH HAS BEEN DRIVING THEIR CHOICES FOR SO LONG ROBERT FROST ONE SAID THAT IT IS POETRY THAT IS LOST IN TRANSLATION THIS SUGGESTS THAT WHATEVER IS BEAUTIFUL AND MOVING WHATEVER GIVES US A NEW WAY TO SEE CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED TO THOSE WHO SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THE JUICE OF BRODSKY SAID THAT IT IS POETRY THAT IS GAINED IN TRANSLATION SUGGESTING THAT TRANSLATION CAN BE A CREATIVE TRANSFORMATIVE ACT WHEN IT COMES TO CHOICE WE HAVE FAR MORE TO GAIN THAN TO LOSE BY BY ENGAGING IN THE MANY TRANSLATIONS OF THE NARRATIVES INSTEAD OF REPLACING ONE STORY WITH ANOTHER WE CAN LEARN FROM AND REVEL IN THE MANY VERSIONS THAT EXIST AND THE MANY THAT HAVE YET TO BE WRITTEN NO MATTER WHERE WE'RE FROM AND WHAT YOUR NARRATIVE IS WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OPEN OURSELVES UP TO A WIDER ARRAY OF WHAT CHOICE CAN DO AND WHAT IT CAN REPRESENT AND THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO A PARALYZING MORAL RELATIVISM RATHER IT TEACHES US WHEN AND HOW TO ACT IT BRINGS US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO REALIZING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF CHOICE TO INSPIRING THE HOPE OF ACHIEVING THE FREEDOM THAT CHOICE PROMISES BUT DOESN'T ALWAYS DELIVER IF WE LEARN TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER ALBEIT THROUGH TRANSLATION THAN WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE CHOICE IN ALL ITS STRANGENESS COMPLEXITY AND COMPELLING BEAUTY THANK YOU OR DEEPER RED RUBBER RETURN IN ORDER TO YOUR BIRD ADDED PRESSURES FROM REPORTERS MURDERS HOW LIBERALS FOR SURE TREASURE CRUISE THROUGH TO TRIP FROM PEOPLE SMOKE IS THIRTY TWO GIRLS HERE BUT IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU SHOULD ASK THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INTERESTING ABOUT BEING BLIND AS YOU ACTUALLY GET A DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT WHEN YOU OBSERVE THE WAY SIGHTED PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES AND AS YOU JUST MENTIONED IS LOTS OF CHOICES OUT THERE THAT ARE VERY VISUAL THESE DAYS I LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT GET PRETTY FRUSTRATED BY CHOICES LIKE WHAT NAIL POLISH COLOR TO PUT ON BECAUSE I HAVE TO RELY ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TO JUST WRITE AND I CAN'T DECIDE AND SO ONE TIME I WAS IN A BEAUTY SALON AND I WAS TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN TWO VERY LIGHT SHADES OF PINK AND ONE WAS CALLED BALLET SLIPPERS AND THE OTHER ONE WAS CALLED A DURABLE AND SO I ASK THESE TWO LADIES IN THE ONE LADY TOLD ME WELL YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WERE BALLET SLIPPERS OR WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WELL IT'S A VERY ELEGANT SHADE OF PINK OKAY GREAT THE OTHER LADY TELLS ME TO WERE ADORABLE WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S A GLAMOROUS SHADE OF PINK AND SO I ASK HOW DO I TELL THEM APART WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM AND THEY SELL WILL ONE IS ELEGANT THE OTHER ONES GLAMOROUS OKAY WE GOT THAT AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAD CONSENSUS ON WILL IF I COULD SEE THEM I WOULD CLEARLY BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART AND WHAT I WONDERED WAS WHETHER THEY WERE BEING AFFECTED BY THE NAME OR THE CONTENTS OF THE COLOR SO I DECIDED TO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT SO I BROUGHT THESE LITTLE THESE TWO BOTTLES OF NAIL POLISH AND DID THE LABORATORY AND I STRIPPED THE LABELS OFF AND I BROUGHT WOMEN INTO THE LABORATORY AND AN AWESOME WISH WE WOULD YOU PICK FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WOMEN ACCUSED ME OF PLAYING A TRICK OF PUTTING THE SAME COLOR NAIL POLISH AND BOTH THOSE LOT OF YEAH WHICH WAY YOU START TO WONDER WHO THE TRICKS REALLY PLAYED ON NOW OTHER THE OF THE WOMEN THAT COULD TELL THEM APART WHEN THE LABELS WERE OFF THEY PICKED ADORABLE AND WHEN THE NAVAL WHEN THE LABELS WERE ON A PAIR BALLET SLIPPERS SO AS FAR AS I CAN TELL A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME PROBABLY DOES LOOK DIFFERENT AND MAYBE EVEN SMELLS DIFFERENT,TODAY I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTEEN MINUTES MY BASE OF OPERATIONS IS IN THE US BUT LET'S START AT THE OTHER END OF THE MAP IN KYOTO JAPAN WHERE I WAS LIVING WITH A JAPANESE FAMILY WHILE I WAS DOING PART OF MY DISSERTATIONAL RESEARCH FIFTEEN YEARS AGO I KNEW EVEN THEN THAT I WOULD ENCOUNTER CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS BUT THEY POPPED UP WHEN I LEAST EXPECTED IT ON MY FIRST DAY I WENT TO A RESTAURANT AND I ORDERED A CUP OF GREEN TEA WITH SUGAR AFTER A PAUSE THE WAITER SAID ONE DOES NOT PUT SUGAR IN GREEN TEA I KNOW I SAID I'M AWARE OF THIS CUSTOM BUT I REALLY LIKE MY TEA SWEET IN RESPONSE HE GAVE ME AN EVEN MORE COURTEOUS VERSION OF THE SAME EXPLANATION ONE DOES NOT PUT SUGAR IN GREEN TEA I UNDERSTAND I SAID THAT THE JAPANESE DO NOT PUT SUGAR IN THEIR GREEN TEA BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT SOME SUGAR IN MY GREEN TEA SURPRISED BY MY INSISTENCE THE WAITER TOOK UP THE ISSUE WITH THE MANAGER PRETTY SOON A LENGTHY DISCUSSION ENSUED AND FINALLY THE MANAGER CAME OVER TO ME AND SAID I AM VERY SORRY WE DO NOT HAVE SUGAR WELL SINCE I COULDN'T HAVE MY TEA THE WAY I WANTED IT I ORDERED A CUP OF COFFEE WHICH THE WAITER BROUGHT OVER PROMPTLY RESTING ON THE SAUCER WERE TWO PACKETS OF SUGAR MY FAILURE TO PROCURE MYSELF A CUP OF SWEET GREEN TEA WAS NOT DUE TO A SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDING THIS WAS DUE TO A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN OUR IDEAS ABOUT CHOICE FROM MY AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE WHEN A PAYING CUSTOMER MAKES A REASONABLE REQUEST BASED ON HER PREFERENCES SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO HAVE THAT REQUEST MET THE AMERICAN WAY TO QUOTE BURGER KING IS TO HAVE IT YOUR WAY BECAUSE AS STARBUCKS SAYS HAPPINESS IS IN YOUR CHOICES BUT FROM THE JAPANESE PERSPECTIVE IT'S THEIR DUTY TO PROTECT THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER IN THIS CASE THE IGNORANT GAIJIN FROM MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE LET'S FACE IT THE WAY I WANTED MY TEA WAS INAPPROPRIATE ACCORDING TO CULTURAL STANDARDS AND THEY WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP ME SAVE FACE AMERICANS TEND TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE REACHED SOME SORT OF PINNACLE IN THE WAY THEY PRACTICE CHOICE THEY THINK THAT CHOICE AS SEEN THROUGH THE AMERICAN LENS BEST FULFILLS AN INNATE AND UNIVERSAL DESIRE FOR CHOICE IN ALL HUMANS UNFORTUNATELY THESE BELIEFS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT DON'T ALWAYS HOLD TRUE IN MANY COUNTRIES IN MANY CULTURES AT TIMES THEY DON'T EVEN HOLD TRUE AT AMERICA'S OWN BORDERS I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS SOME OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AS I DO SO I HOPE YOU'LL START THINKING ABOUT SOME OF YOUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS AND HOW THEY WERE SHAPED BY YOUR BACKGROUNDS IF A CHOICE AFFECTS YOU THEN YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE TO MAKE IT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PREFERENCES AND INTERESTS WILL BE MOST FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN AMERICA THE PRIMARY LOCUS OF CHOICE IS THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE MUST CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES

AND I DID A SERIES OF STUDIES IN WHICH WE SOUGHT THE ANSWER TO THIS VERY QUESTION IN ONE STUDY WHICH WE RAN IN JAPANTOWN SAN FRANCISCO WE BROUGHT SEVEN TO NINE YEAR OLD ANGLO AND ASIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN INTO THE LABORATORY AND WE DIVIDED THEM UP INTO THREE GROUPS THE FIRST GROUP CAME IN AND THEY WERE GREETED BY MISS SMITH WHO SHOWED THEM SIX BIG PILES OF ANAGRAM PUZZLES THE KIDS GOT TO CHOOSE WHICH PILE OF ANAGRAMS THEY WOULD LIKE TO DO AND THEY EVEN GOT TO CHOOSE WHICH MARKER THEY WOULD WRITE THEIR ANSWERS WITH WHEN THE SECOND GROUP OF CHILDREN CAME IN THEY WERE BROUGHT TO THE SAME ROOM SHOWN THE SAME ANAGRAMS BUT THIS TIME MISS SMITH TOLD THEM WHICH ANAGRAMS TO DO AND WHICH MARKERS TO WRITE THEIR ANSWERS WITH NOW WHEN THE THIRD GROUP CAME IN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR ANAGRAMS AND THEIR MARKERS HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY THEIR MOTHERS IN REALITY THE KIDS WHO WERE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHETHER BY MISS SMITH OR THEIR MOTHERS WERE ACTUALLY GIVEN THE VERY SAME ACTIVITY WHICH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE FIRST GROUP HAD FREELY CHOSEN WITH THIS PROCEDURE WE WERE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE KIDS ACROSS THE THREE GROUPS ALL DID THE SAME ACTIVITY MAKING IT EASIER FOR US TO COMPARE

GOT TO CHOOSE THEM AS COMPARED TO WHEN IT WAS CHOSEN FOR THEM BY MISS SMITH OR THEIR MOTHERS IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO DID THE CHOOSING IF THE TASK WAS DICTATED BY ANOTHER THEIR PERFORMANCE SUFFERED IN FACT SOME OF THE KIDS WERE VISIBLY EMBARRASSED WHEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEIR MOTHERS HAD BEEN CONSULTED ONE GIRL NAMED MARY SAID YOU ASKED MY MOTHER IN CONTRAST ASIAN AMERICAN CHILDREN PERFORMED BEST

SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM AND TUGGED ON HER SKIRT AND ASKED COULD YOU PLEASE TELL MY MOMMY I DID IT JUST LIKE SHE SAID THE FIRST GENERATION CHILDREN WERE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR IMMIGRANT PARENTS APPROACH TO CHOICE FOR THEM CHOICE WAS NOT JUST A WAY OF DEFINING AND ASSERTING THEIR INDIVIDUALITY BUT A WAY TO CREATE COMMUNITY AND HARMONY BY DEFERRING TO THE CHOICES OF PEOPLE WHOM THEY TRUSTED AND RESPECTED IF THEY HAD A CONCEPT OF BEING TRUE TO ONE'S SELF THEN THAT SELF MOST LIKELY COMPOSED NOT OF AN INDIVIDUAL BUT OF A COLLECTIVE SUCCESS WAS JUST AS MUCH ABOUT PLEASING KEY FIGURES AS IT

CAN BE A CREATIVE TRANSFORMATIVE ACT WHEN IT COMES TO CHOICE WE HAVE FAR MORE TO GAIN THAN TO LOSE BY ENGAGING IN THE MANY TRANSLATIONS OF THE NARRATIVES INSTEAD OF REPLACING ONE STORY WITH ANOTHER WE CAN LEARN FROM AND REVEL IN THE MANY VERSIONS THAT EXIST AND THE MANY THAT HAVE YET TO BE WRITTEN NO MATTER WHERE WE'RE FROM AND WHAT YOUR NARRATIVE IS WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OPEN OURSELVES UP TO A WIDER ARRAY OF WHAT CHOICE CAN DO AND WHAT IT CAN REPRESENT AND THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO A PARALYZING MORAL RELATIVISM RATHER IT TEACHES US WHEN AND HOW TO ACT IT BRINGS US THAT MUCH CLOSER TO REALIZING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF CHOICE TO INSPIRING THE HOPE AND ACHIEVING THE FREEDOM THAT CHOICE PROMISES BUT DOESN'T ALWAYS DELIVER IF WE LEARN TO SPEAK TO ONE ANOTHER ALBEIT THROUGH TRANSLATION THEN WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE CHOICE IN ALL ITS STRANGENESS COMPLEXITY AND COMPELLING BEAUTY THANK YOU THANK YOU SHEENA THERE IS A DETAIL ABOUT YOUR BIOGRAPHY THAT WE HAVE NOT WRITTEN IN THE PROGRAM BOOK BUT BY NOW IT'S EVIDENT TO EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM YOU'RE BLIND AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON EVERYBODY'S MIND IS HOW DOES THAT INFLUENCE YOUR STUDY OF CHOOSING BECAUSE THAT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE IS ASSOCIATED WITH VISUAL INPUTS LIKE AESTHETICS AND COLOR AND SO ON WELL IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU SHOULD ASK THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT BEING BLIND IS YOU ACTUALLY GET A DIFFERENT VANTAGE POINT WHEN YOU OBSERVE THE WAY SIGHTED PEOPLE MAKE CHOICES AND AS YOU JUST MENTIONED THERE'S LOTS OF CHOICES OUT THERE THAT ARE VERY VISUAL THESE DAYS YEAH I AS YOU WOULD EXPECT GET PRETTY FRUSTRATED BY CHOICES LIKE WHAT NAIL POLISH TO PUT ON BECAUSE I HAVE TO RELY ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SUGGEST AND I CAN'T DECIDE AND SO ONE TIME I WAS IN A BEAUTY SALON AND I WAS TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN TWO VERY LIGHT SHADES OF PINK AND ONE WAS CALLED BALLET SLIPPERS AND THE OTHER ONE WAS CALLED ADORABLE AND SO I ASKED THESE TWO LADIES AND THE ONE LADY TOLD ME WELL YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY WEAR BALLET SLIPPERS WELL WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WELL IT'S A VERY ELEGANT SHADE OF PINK OKAY GREAT THE OTHER LADY TELLS ME TO WEAR ADORABLE WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S A GLAMOROUS SHADE OF PINK AND SO I ASKED THEM WELL HOW DO I TELL THEM APART WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM AND THEY SAID WELL ONE IS ELEGANT THE OTHER ONE'S GLAMOROUS OKAY WE GOT THAT AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAD CONSENSUS ON WELL IF I COULD SEE THEM I WOULD CLEARLY BE ABLE TO TELL THEM APART AND WHAT I WONDERED WAS WHETHER THEY WERE BEING AFFECTED BY THE NAME OR THE CONTENT OF THE COLOR SO I DECIDED TO DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT SO I BROUGHT THESE TWO BOTTLES OF NAIL POLISH INTO THE LABORATORY AND I STRIPPED THE LABELS OFF AND I BROUGHT WOMEN INTO THE LABORATORY AND I ASKED THEM WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PICK FIFTY PERCENT OF THE WOMEN ACCUSED ME OF PLAYING A TRICK OF PUTTING THE SAME COLOR NAIL POLISH IN BOTH THOSE BOTTLES AT WHICH POINT YOU START TO WONDER WHO THE TRICK'S REALLY PLAYED ON NOW OF THE WOMEN THAT COULD TELL THEM APART WHEN THE LABELS WERE OFF THEY PICKED ADORABLE AND WHEN THE LABELS WERE ON THEY PICKED BALLET SLIPPERS SO AS FAR AS I CAN TELL A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME PROBABLY DOES LOOK DIFFERENT AND MAYBE EVEN SMELLS DIFFERENT THANK YOU SHEENA IYENGAR THANK YOU SHEENA
