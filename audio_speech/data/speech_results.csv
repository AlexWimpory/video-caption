AlGore_2016-480p,968.0,I WAS EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE DREAM THEME AND THEN I FOUND OUT I'M LEADING OFF A NIGHTMARE A SEX AND NOW THAT AND AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT QUALIFY AND I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE GOOD NEWS I'M GOING TO PROPOSE THREE QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST ONE NECESSARILY INVOLVES A LITTLE BAD NEWS BUT HANG ON BECAUSE THE ANSWERS TO THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS REALLY ARE VERY POSITIVE SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS DO WE REALLY HAVE TO CHANGE AND OF COURSE THE APOLLO MISSION AMONG OTHER THINGS CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT REALLY LAUNCHED THE MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THIS EARTH RISE PICTURE WAS FIRST SEEN ON EARTH THE FIRST EARTH DAY WAS ORGANIZED AND WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT OURSELVES LOOKING BACK AT OUR PLANET FROM SPACE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARN CONFIRMED WHAT THE SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG TOLD US ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL FACTS ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SKY AS THIS PICTURE ILLUSTRATES THE SKY IS NOT THE VAST AND LIMITLESS EXPANSE IT APPEARS WHEN WE LOOK UP FROM THE GROUND IT IS A VERY THIN SHELL OF ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THE PLANET THAT RIGHT NOW IS THE OPEN SEWER FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION AS IT IS CURRENTLY ORGANIZE WE ARE SPEWING ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION TONS OF HEAT TRAPPING GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION INTO IT EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS FREE OF CHARGE GO HIT AND THERE ARE MANY SOURCE SAYS OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH A MALL I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MAIN ONE BUT AGRICULTURE IS INVOLVED DIET IS INVOLVED POPULATION IS INVOLVED MANAGEMENT OF FOREST TRANSPORTATION THE OCEANS THE MELTING OF THE PERMIT FOR US BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS THE FACT THAT WE STILL RELY ON DIRTY CARBON BASED FUELS FOR EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL THE ENERGY THAT OUR WORLD BURNS EVERY YEAR AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS IMAGE THAT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THE EMISSION RIGHT STARTED REALLY ACCELERATING AND THE ACCUMULATED AMOUNT OF MAN MADE GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION THAT IS UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE NOW TRAPS AS MUCH EXTRA HEAT ENERGY AS WOULD BE RELEASED BY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HIROSHIMA CLASS ATOMIC BOMBS EXPLODING EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR FACT CHECKED OVER AND OVER AGAIN CONSERVATIVE IT'S THE TRUTH NOW IT'S A BIG PLANET BUT THAT IS A LOT OF ENERGY PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU MULTIPLY AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES PER DAY AND ALL THAT EXTRA HEAT ENERGY IS HEATING UP THE ATMOSPHERE THE WHOLE EARTH SYSTEM LET'S LOOK AT THE ATMOSPHERE THIS IS A DEPICTION OF WHAT WE USED TO THINK OF AS THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURES THE WHITE REPRESENT NORMAL TEMPERATURE DAYS NINETEEN FIFTY ONE TO NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ARBITRARILY CHOSEN THE BLUE OR COOLER THAN AVERAGE DAYS THE RED OR WARMER THAN AVERAGE DAYS BUT THE ENTIRE CURVE HAS MOVED TO THE RIGHT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER THE APPEARANCE OF STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF EXTREMELY HOT DAYS IN THE NINETIES THE CURVE SHIFTED FURTHER IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE THE EXTREMELY HOT DAYS ARE NOW MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE COOLER THAN AVERAGE DAYS IN FACT THEY ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES MORE COMMON ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THAN THEY WERE JUST THIRTY YEARS AGO SO WE'RE HAVING RECORD BREAKING IT TEMPERATURES FOURTEEN OF THE FIFTEEN HOTTEST YEARS EVER MEASURED WITH INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THIS YOUNG CENTURY ON THE HARDEST OF ALL WAS LAST YEAR LAST MONTH WAS A THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIRST MONTH IN A ROW WARMER THAN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AVERAGE AND THE FOR THE FIRST TIME NOT ONLY A WARM AS JANUARY BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS MORE THAN TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER THAN THE AVERAGE THESE HIGHER TEMPERATURES ARE HAVING AN EFFECT ON ANIMALS PLANTS PEOPLE ECOSYSTEMS BUT ON A GLOBAL BASIS NINETY THREE PERCENT OF ALL THE EXTRA HEAT ENERGY IS TRAPPED IN THE OCEANS AND THE SCIENTISTS CAN MEASURE THE HEAT BUILDUP MUCH MORE PRECISELY NOW AT ALL DEATHS BE MIT OCEAN THE FIRST FEW HUNDRED METERS AND THIS TOO IS ACCELERATING IT GOES BACK MORE THAN A CENTURY AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE INCREASE HAS BEEN IN THE LAST NINETEEN YEARS THIS HAS CONSEQUENCES FIRST ORDER CONSEQUENCE THE OCEAN BASED ARMS GET STRONGER SUPER TYPHOON HIGH ON WENT OVER AREAS OF THE PACIFIC FIVE AND A HALF DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER THAN NORMAL BEFORE IT SLAMMED INTO TITLE OMAN IS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE STORM EVER TO MAKE LANDFALL POPE FRANCIS WHO HAS MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO THIS WHOLE ISSUE VISITED TACKLE BON RIGHT AFTER THAT SUPERSTAR SANDY WENT OVER AREAS OF THE ATLANTIC NINE DEGREES WARMER THAN NORMAL BEFORE SLAMMING INTO NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY THE SECOND ORDER CONSEQUENCES ARE AFFECTING ALL OF US RIGHT NOW THE WARMER OCEANS ARE EVAPORATING MUCH MORE WATER VAPOR INTO THE SKIES AVERAGE HUMIDITY WORLDWIDE IS GONE UP MORE THAN FOUR PERCENT AND IT CREATES THESE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS THE BRAZILIAN SCIENTISTS CALL HIM FLYING RIVERS AND THEY FUN ALL OF THAT EXTRA WATER VAPOR OVER THE LAND WHERE STORM CONDITIONS TRIGGER THESE MASSIVE RECORD BREAKING DOWNPOURS THIS IS FROM MONTANA TAKE A LOOK AT THIS STORM LAST AUGUST AS IT MOVES OVER TO SON ARIZONA IT LITERALLY SPLASHES OFF THE CITY HE'S DOWNPOURS ARE REALLY UNUSUAL LAST JULY IN HOUSTON TEXAS IT RAIN FOR TWO DAYS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO BILLION GALLONS THAT REPRESENTS MORE THAN TWO DAYS OF THE FULL FLOW OF NIAGARA FALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY WHICH WAS COURSE PARALYZED THESE RECORD DOWNPOURS ARE CREATING HISTORIC FLOOD ADS AND MUDSLIDES THIS ONE IS FROM KILL A LAST YEAR AND YOU SEE THAT WAREHOUSE GOING BY THEIR OIL TANKER CARS GOING BY THIS IS FROM SPAIN LAST SEPTEMBER YOU COULD CALL THIS THE RUNNING OF THE CARS AND TRUCKS I GUESS EVERY NIGHT ON THE TV NEWS NOW IS LIKE A NATURE HIKE THROUGH THE BOOK OF REVELATION I MEAN REALLY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS CERTAINLY NOTICED THE LOSSES HAVE BEEN MOUNTING UP THEY'RE NOT UNDER ANY ILLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE CAUSALITY REQUIRES A MOMENT OF DISCUSSION WERE USED TO THINKING OF LINEAR CAUSE AND LINEAR AFFECT ONE CAUSE ONE EFFECT THIS IS SYSTEMIC CAUSATION AS THE GREAT HEAVEN TREMOR SAYS ALL STORMS ARE DIFFERENT NOW THERE'S SO MUCH EXTRA ENERGY IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE SO MUCH EXTRA WATER VAPOR EVERY STORM IS DIFFERENT NOW SO THE SAME EXTRA HEAT PULLS THE SOIL MOISTURE OUT OF THE GROUND AND CAUSES THESE DEEPER LONGER MORE PERVASIVE DROUGHTS AND MANY OF THEM ARE UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW IT DRIES OUT THE VEGETATION AND CAUSES MORE FIRES IN THE WESTERN PART OF NORTH AMERICA THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN EVIDENCE OF THAT A LOT OF THEM MORE LIGHTNING AS THE HEAT ENERGY BILLS UP THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL LIGHTNING ALSO THESE CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS ALSO HAVE GEO POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES AND CREATE INSTABILITY THE CLIMATE RELATED HISTORIC DROUGHT THAT STARTED IN SYRIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX DESTROYED SIXTY PERCENT OF THE FARMS IN SYRIA KILLED EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE LIVESTOCK AND DROVE ONE AND A HALF MILLION CLIMATE REFUGEES INTO THE CITIES OF SYRIA WHERE THEY COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER ONE AND A HALF MILLION REFUGEES FROM THE IRAQ WAR AND ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT OPEN THE GATES OF HELL THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CLOSE NOW THE US DEFENSE DEPARTMENT HAS LONG WARNED OF CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CLIMATE CRISIS INCLUDING A REFUGEES INCLUDING FOOD AND WATER SHORTAGES AND PANDEMIC DISEASE RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING MICROBIAL DISEASES FROM THE TROPIC SPREAD TO THE HIGHER LATITUDES THE TRANSPORTATION REVOLUTION HAS HAD A LOT TO DO WITH THIS BUT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS CHANGE THE LATITUDES AND THE AREAS WHERE THESE MICROBIAL DISEASES CAN CAN BECOME ENDEMIC AND CHANGE THE RANGE OF THE THE VECTORS LIKE MOSQUITOES ANTICS THAT CARRY THEM THE SEEKER EPIDEMIC NOW WE'RE BETTER POSITIONED IN NORTH AMERICA BECAUSE IT'S STILL A LITTLE TOO COOL AND WE HAVE A BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BUT WHEN WOMEN IN SOME REGIONS OF SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA ARE ADVISED NOT TO GET PREGNANT FOR TWO YEARS AS SOMETHING NEW THAT OUGHT TO GET OUR ATTENTION THE LANCET ONE OF THE TWO GREATEST MEDICAL JOURNALS AND THE WORLD LAST SUMMER LABELED THIS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY NOW AND THERE ARE MANY FACTORS BECAUSE OF IT THIS IS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE EXTINCTION CRISIS WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOSING FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL THE LIVING SPECIES ON EARTH BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY AND ALREADY LAND BASED PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE NOW MOVING TOWARD THE POLLS AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF FIFTEEN FEET PER DAY SPEAKING OF THE NORTH POLE LAST DECEMBER TWENTY NINTH THE SAME STORM THAT CAUSED HIS START FLOODING IN THE AMERICAN MIDWEST RAISE TEMPERATURES AT THE NORTH POLE FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER THAN NORMAL CAUSING THE THAWING OF THE NORTH POLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LONG DARK WINTER POLAR NIGHT AND WHEN THE LAND BASED ICE OF THE ARCTIC MELTS IT RAISES SEA LEVEL PAUL NICHOLLS BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH FROM SMALL BARD ILLUSTRATES THIS IT'S MORE DANGEROUS COMING OFF GREENLAND AND PARTICULARLY ANTARCTICA THE TEN LARGEST A RISK CITIES FOR SEA LEVEL RISE BY POPULATION ARE MOSTLY IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA WHEN YOU MEASURE IT BY ASSETS AT RISK NUMBER ONE IS MIAMI THREE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS AT RISK NUMBER THREE NEW YORK AND NEW YORK I WAS IN MIAMI LAST FALL DURING THE SUPER MOON ONE OF THE HIGHEST A HIGH TIDE DAYS AND THERE WERE FISH FROM THE OCEAN SWIMMING IN SOME OF THE STREETS OF MIAMI BEACH IN FORT LAUDERDALE AND DEL RAY AND THIS HAPPENS REGULARLY DURING THE HIGHEST HIGH TIDES NOW NOT WITH RAIN THEY CALL IT SUNNY DAY FLOODING IT COMES UP THROUGH THE STORM SEWERS AND THE MAYOR OF MIAMI SPEAKS FOR MANY WHEN HE SAYS IT IS LONG PAST TIME JUST CAN BE VIEWED THROUGH A PARTISAN LANCE THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY WE HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND PARTISANSHIP AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HONOR THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAS THE COURAGE CLASS STEP OUT AND TAKE A POLITICAL RISK BY BY TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS SO THE COST OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS MOUNTING UP THERE ARE MANY OF THESE ASPECTS I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTION IT'S AN ENORMOUS BURDEN I'LL MENTION JUST ONE MORE BECAUSE THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM LAST MONTH IN DAVOS AFTER THEIR ANNUAL SURVEY OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY ECONOMISTS SAID THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SO YOU GET CENTRAL BANKERS LIKE MARK CORNY THE HEAD OF THE U K CENTRAL BANK SAYING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CARBON RESERVES ARE AND BURN A BALL SUB PRIME CARBON I'M NOT GOING TO REMIND YOU OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH SUB PRIME MORTGAGES BUT IT'S THE SAME THING IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE CARBON FUELS THAT WERE BURNED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVELED LUCIAN THIS IS THE QUANTITY BURNED IN THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS HERE ALL THE ONES THAT ARE PROVEN AND LEFT ON THE BOOKS TWENTY EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY SAYS ONLY THIS AMOUNT CAN BE BURNED SO THE REST TWO THOUSAND AND TWO TRILLION DOLLARS AND BERNAL RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AS ONE OF THE DIVESTMENT MOVEMENT MAKES PRACTICAL SENSE AND NOT JUST IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE NOW SO THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST WE CHANGE IS YES WE HAVE TO CHANGE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE THIS IS THE EXCITING NEWS THE BEST PROJECTIONS IN THE WORLD SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WHERE THAT BY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE WORLD WOULD BE ABLE TO INSTALL THIRTY GIGGLE LOTS OF WIND CAPACITY WE BEAT THAT MARK BY FOURTEEN AND A HALF TIMES OVER WE SEE AN EXPONENTIAL CURVE FOR WIND INSTALLATIONS NOW WE SEE THE CAUSE COMING DOWN DRAMATICALLY SOME COUNTRIES TAKE GERMANY AND INDUSTRIAL POWERHOUSE WITH THE CLIMATE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM VANCOUVER'S BY THE WAY ONE DAY LAST DECEMBER GOT EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL OF ITS ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES MAINLY SOLAR AND WIND LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE GETTING MORE THAN HALF ON AN AVERAGE BASIS MORE GOOD NEWS ENERGY STORAGE FROM BATTERIES PARTICULARLY IS NOW BEGINNING TO TAKE TAKE OFF BECAUSE THE COST HAS BEEN COMING DOWN VERY DRAMATICALLY TO SOLVE THE INTERMITTENTLY PROBLEM WITH SOLAR THE NEWS IS EVEN MORE EXCITING THE BEST PROJECTIONS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO WHERE THAT WE WOULD INSTALL ONE GIG OR WANT PER YEAR BY TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WHEN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN CAME AROUND WE BE FAT MARKED BY SEVENTEEN TIMES OVER LAST YEAR WE BEAT IT BY FIFTY EIGHT TIMES OVER THIS YEAR WE'RE ON TRACK TO BEAT AT SIXTY EIGHT TIMES OVER WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS WE ARE GOING TO PREVAIL THE EXPONENTIAL CURVE ON SOLAR IS EVEN STEEPER AND MORE DRAMATIC WHEN I CAME TO THIS STAGE TEN YEARS AGO THIS IS WHERE IT WAS WE HAVE SEEN A REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH IN THE EMERGENCE OF THESE AND THE COST HAS COME DOWN TEN PERCENT PER YEAR FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT'S CONTINUING TO COME DOWN NOW THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY A CERTAINLY NOTICE THIS BECAUSE IT'S CROSSING THE GRID PARITY POINT CHEAPER SOLAR PENETRATION RATES ARE BEGINNING TO RISE GRID PAIR PRETTY IS UNDERSTOOD IS THAT LINE THAT THRESHOLD BE LOW WHICH RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IS CHEAPER THAN ELECTRICITY FROM BURNING FOSSIL FUELS THAT THRESHOLD IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIRTY TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THIRTY THREE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OR ZERO AND ONE CELSIUS IT'S A DIFFERENCE OF MORE THAN ONE DEGREE IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ICE AND WATER AND IN MARKETS IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKETS THAT ARE FROZEN UP AND LIQUID FLOWS OF CAPITAL INTO NEW OPERA KENNEDY'S FOR INVESTMENT THIS IS THE BIGGEST NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND TWO THIRDS OF IT IS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE ARE SEEING AN EXPLOSION OF NEW INVESTMENT STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN INVESTMENTS GLOBALLY IN RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATION SURPASS FOSSILS THE GAP HAS BEEN GROWING EVER SENSE OF THE PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN MORE DRAMATIC EVEN THOUGH FOSSIL ENERGY IS NOW STILL SUBSIDIZED AT A RATE FORTY TIMES LARGER THAN RENEWALS AND BY THE WAY IF YOU ADD THE PROJECTIONS FOR NUCLEAR ON HERE AND PARTICULARLY IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE WORK MANY ARE DOING TO TRY TO BREAK THROUGH TO SAFER AND MORE ACCEPTABLE MORE AFFORDABLE FORMS OF NUCLEAR THIS COULD CHANGE EVEN MORE DRAMATICALLY SO IS THERE ANY PRECEDENT FOR SUCH A RAPID ADOPTION OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY WELL THERE ARE MANY BUT LET'S LOOK AT CELL PHONES AND NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND T THAN MA BELL COMMISSION MCKINSEY TO DO A GLOBAL MARKET SURVEY OF THOSE CLUNKY NEW MOBILE PHONES THAT APPEARED THEN HOW MANY CAN WE SELL BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND THEY ASK ME KINSEY CAME BACK AND SAID NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND RATHER THEY DIDN'T SELL NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FIRST THREE DAYS AND FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR THEY SOLD ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TIMES MORE AND NOW THERE ARE MORE SELL CONNECTIONS THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD SO WHY WERE THEY NOT ONLY WRONG BUT WAY WRONG I'VE ASKED THAT QUESTION MYSELF WHY AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS IN THREE PARTS FIRST THE COST CAME DOWN MUCH FASTER THAN ANY BY EXPECTED EVEN AS THE QUALITY WENT OUT AND LOW INCOME COUNTRIES PLACES THAT DID NOT HAVE A LANDLINE GRID THEY LEAP FROG TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THE BIG EXPANSION HAS BEEN IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SO WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY GRIDS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD WELL NOT SO HOT AND IN MANY AREAS THEY DON'T EXIST THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY AT ALL IN INDIA THAN THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO NOW WE'RE GETTING THIS SOLAR PANELS ON GRASS HUTS AND NEW BUSINESS MODELS THAT MAKE IT AFFORDABLE MUHAMMAD UNITS FINANCE THIS ONE IN BANGLADESH WITH A MICRO CREDIT THIS IS A VILLAGE MARKET BANGLADESH IS NOW THE FASTEST DEPLOYING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TO SYSTEMS PER MINUTE ON AVERAGE NIGHT AND DAY AND WE HAVE ALL WE NEED ENOUGH ENERGY FROM THE SUN COMES TO THE EARTH EVERY HOUR TO SUPPLY THE FULL WORLD'S ENERGY NEEDS FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY BIT LESS THAN AN HOUR SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE IS CLEARLY YES AND IT'S AN EVER FIRMER YES NOW SO LAST QUESTION WILL WE CHANGE PARISH REALLY WAS A BREAKTHROUGH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS ARE BINDING AND THE REGULAR REVIEWS WILL MATTER A LOT BUT NATIONS AREN'T WAITING THEY'RE GOING AHEAD CHINA HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT STARTING NEXT YEAR THEY ARE ADOPTING A NATIONWIDE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM THEY WILL LIKELY LINK UP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THE UNITED STATES HAS ALREADY BEEN CHANGING ALL OF THESE COAL PLANTS WERE PROPOSED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS AND CANCELLED ALL OF THESE EXISTING COAL PLANTS WERE RETIRED ALL OF THESE COLD PLAN HAVE HAD THEIR RETIREMENT ANNOUNCED ALL OF THEM CANCEL WE ARE MOVING FORWARD LAST YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE INVESTMENT IN NEW ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE UNITED STATES ALMOST THREE QUARTERS WAS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY MOSTLY WIND AND SOLAR WE ARE SOLVING THIS CRISIS THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET THERE SO IT MATTERS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ORGANIZING TO INSIST ON THIS CHANGE NOW ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHED IN NEW YORK CITY BEFORE THE U IN SPECIAL SESSION ON THIS MANY THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS MARCHED IN CITIES AROUND THE WORLD AND SO I AM EXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC AS I SAID BEFORE WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS I'LL FINISH WITH THIS STORY WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD I HEARD THAT PROPOSAL BY PRESIDENT KENNEDY THE LAND A PERSON ON THE MOON AND BRING HIM BACK SAFELY AND TEN YEARS AND I HEARD ADULTS OF THAT DAY AND TIME SAY THAT'S RECKLESS EXPENSIVE MAY WELL FAIL BUT EIGHT YEARS AND TWO MONTHS LATER IN THE MOMENT THAT NEIL ARMSTRONG SET FOOT ON THE MOON THERE WAS A GREAT SHEER THAT WENT UP IN NASA MISSION CONTROL IN HOUSTON HERE IS A LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT THAT THE AVERAGE AGE AGE OF THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERS THE CONTROLLERS IN THE ROOM THAT DAY WAS TWENTY SIX WHICH MEANS AMONG OTHER THINGS THEIR AGE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT CHALLENGE WAS EIGHTEEN WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE FACE ONE OF THE GREATEST POETS OF THE LAST CENTURY IN THE US WALLACE STEVENS WROTE A LINE THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME AFTER THE FINAL KNOW THERE COMES A YES AND ON THAT YES THE FUTURE WORLD DEPENDS WHEN THE ABOLITION OF STARTED THEIR MOVEMENT THEY MET WITH NO AFTER KNOW AFTER KNOW AND THEN CAME A YES THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT MET ANALYSTS KNOWS UNTIL FINALLY THERE WAS A YES THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE MOVEMENT AGAINST APARTHEID AND MORE RECENTLY THE MOVEMENT FOR GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AFTER THE FINAL NO COMES A YES WHEN ANY GREAT MORAL CHALLENGE IS ULTIMATELY RESOLVED INTO A BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG THE OUTCOME IS FOR AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS NINETY NINE PERCENT OF US THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW ENTERED IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED SOME STILL DOUBT THAT WE HAVE THE WILL TO ACT BUT I SAY THE WILL TO ACT IS ITSELF A RENEWABLE RESOURCE SOURCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU'VE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE COMBINATIONS COZY SCIENTISTS MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF ISSUES THE ABILITY TO TURN IT INTO THE MOST VIVID LANGUAGE NO ONE ELSE CAN DO THAT WHY YOU LET THIS THING AND IT'S AMAZING TO SEE TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE IT NOW WELL YOU'RE NICE TO SAY THAT CHRIS BUT HONESTLY I HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD FRIENDS IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHO ARE INCREDIBLY PATIENT AND WHO WILL SIT THERE EXPLAIN THIS STUFF TO ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL I CAN GET IT INTO SIMPLE ENOUGH LANGUAGE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND THAT'S THE KEY TO TRYING TO COMMUNICATE FIRST PART TERRIFYING SECOND INCREDIBLY HELPFUL HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ALL THOSE GRAPHS OR THAT PROGRESS IS ENOUGH TO SOLVE WHAT YOU SHOWED IN THE FIRST PART WELL I THINK THAT THE CROSSING A YOU KNOW I'VE ONLY BEEN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE INCOME AND OR CHEAPER THAN TURNS OUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF IT'S CHEAPER THAN AND WHEN IT CROSSES THAT LINE THEN A LOT OF THINGS REALLY CHANGED WE ARE REGULARLY SURPRISED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS THE LATE RUDY DORN BUSH THE GREAT ECONOMISTS SAID YOU KNOW THINGS TAKE LONGER TO HAPPEN THAN YOU THINK THEY WILL AND THEN THEY HAPPEN MUCH FASTER THAN YOU THOUGHT THEY COULD I REALLY THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE USING THE PHRASE THE SOLAR SINGULARITY NOW MEANING WHEN IT GETS BELOW THE GRID PARITY UNSUBSIDIZED IN MOST PLACES THEN IT'S THE DEFAULT CHOICE NOW IN IN IN ONE OF THE PRESENTATIONS YESTERDAY THE JITNEY THING THERE IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO USE REGULATIONS TO SLOW THIS DOWN AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S KIND OF WORK THERE'S A WOMAN IN ATLANTA DEBBIE DULY WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ATLANTA TEA PARTY THEY ENLISTED HER IN THIS EFFORT TO PUT A TAX ON SOLAR PANELS AND REGULATIONS AND SHE HAD JUST PUT SOLAR PANELS ON A ROOF AND SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST AND SO SHE WENT AND FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH SIERRA CLUB AND THEY FORMED A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE GREEN TEA PARTY AND AND THE PROPOSAL FINALLY THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THIS THE SOUNDS A LITTLE CORNY AND MAYBE IT'S A CLICHE BUT TEN YEARS AGO AND CRISTIANO REFERRED TO THIS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE WHO PLAYED AN INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN GENERATING THOSE EXPONENTIAL CURVES AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT ECONOMICALLY FOR SOME OF THEM BUT KICK STARTED THIS GLOBAL REVOLUTION AND WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE DO NOW WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS BUT IT MATTERS A LOT HOW FAST WE WIN IT THAT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE THE YEAR THAT THE PARTISAN THING CHANGES THIS IS NO LONGER AS YOU SAID IT'S NO LONGER A PARTISAN ISSUE THAT YOU BRING ALONG PEOPLE FROM THE OTHER SIDE TOGETHER BANKS BY SCIENCE BANKS BY THESE KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES BACKED BY REASON THAT YOU IN THE DAY BOY THAT'S REALLY EXCITING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR RETIREMENT,I WAS EXCITED TO BE A PART OF THE DREAM THEME AND THEN I FOUND OUT I'M LEADING OFF THE NIGHTMARE SECTION OF IT AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE THINGS ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS THAT QUALIFY AND I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE GOOD NEWS I'M GOING TO PROPOSE THREE QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST ONE NECESSARILY INVOLVES A LITTLE BAD NEWS BUT HANG ON BECAUSE THE ANSWERS TO THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS REALLY ARE VERY POSITIVE SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS DO WE REALLY HAVE TO CHANGE AND OF COURSE THE APOLLO MISSION AMONG OTHER THINGS CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT REALLY LAUNCHED THE MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER THIS EARTHRISE PICTURE WAS FIRST SEEN ON EARTH THE FIRST EARTH DAY WAS ORGANIZED AND WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT OURSELVES LOOKING BACK AT OUR PLANET FROM SPACE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED CONFIRMED WHAT THE SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG TOLD US ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL FACTS ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SKY AS THIS PICTURE ILLUSTRATES THE SKY IS NOT THE VAST AND LIMITLESS EXPANSE THAT APPEARS WHEN WE LOOK UP FROM THE GROUND IT IS A VERY THIN SHELL OF ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THE PLANET THAT RIGHT NOW IS THE OPEN SEWER FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION AS IT'S CURRENTLY ORGANIZED WE ARE SPEWING ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION TONS OF HEAT TRAPPING GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION INTO IT EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS FREE OF CHARGE GO AHEAD AND THERE ARE MANY SOURCES OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM ALL I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MAIN ONE BUT AGRICULTURE IS INVOLVED DIET IS INVOLVED POPULATION IS INVOLVED MANAGEMENT OF FORESTS TRANSPORTATION THE OCEANS THE MELTING OF THE PERMAFROST BUT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM WHICH IS THE FACT THAT WE STILL RELY ON DIRTY CARBON BASED FUELS FOR EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL THE ENERGY THAT OUR WORLD BURNS EVERY YEAR AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS IMAGE THAT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THE EMISSION RATES STARTED REALLY ACCELERATING AND THE ACCUMULATED AMOUNT OF MAN MADE

TIMES MORE COMMON ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THAN THEY WERE JUST THIRTY YEARS AGO SO WE'RE HAVING RECORD BREAKING TEMPERATURES FOURTEEN OF THE FIFTEEN OF THE HOTTEST YEARS EVER MEASURED WITH INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THIS YOUNG CENTURY THE HOTTEST OF ALL WAS LAST YEAR LAST MONTH WAS THE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIRST MONTH IN A ROW WARMER THAN THE TWENTYTH CENTURY AVERAGE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME NOT ONLY THE WARMEST JANUARY BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IT WAS MORE THAN TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER THAN THE AVERAGE THESE HIGHER TEMPERATURES ARE HAVING AN EFFECT ON ANIMALS PLANTS PEOPLE ECOSYSTEMS BUT ON A GLOBAL BASIS NINETY THREE PERCENT OF ALL THE EXTRA HEAT ENERGY IS TRAPPED IN THE OCEANS AND THE SCIENTISTS CAN MEASURE THE HEAT BUILDUP MUCH MORE PRECISELY NOW AT ALL DEPTHS DEEP MID OCEAN THE FIRST FEW HUNDRED METERS AND THIS TOO IS ACCELERATING IT GOES BACK MORE THAN A CENTURY AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE INCREASE HAS BEEN IN THE LAST NINETEEN YEARS THIS HAS CONSEQUENCES THE FIRST ORDER OF CONSEQUENCE THE OCEAN BASED STORMS GET STRONGER SUPER TYPHOON HAIYAN WENT OVER AREAS OF THE PACIFIC FIVE AND A HALF DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER THAN NORMAL BEFORE IT SLAMMED INTO TACLOBAN AS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE STORM EVER TO MAKE LANDFALL POPE FRANCIS WHO HAS MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE TO THIS WHOLE ISSUE VISITED TACLOBAN RIGHT AFTER THAT SUPERSTORM SANDY WENT OVER AREAS OF THE ATLANTIC NINE DEGREES WARMER THAN NORMAL BEFORE SLAMMING INTO NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY THE SECOND ORDER OF CONSEQUENCES ARE AFFECTING ALL OF US RIGHT NOW THE WARMER OCEANS ARE EVAPORATING MUCH MORE WATER VAPOR INTO THE SKIES AVERAGE HUMIDITY WORLDWIDE HAS GONE UP FOUR PERCENT AND IT CREATES THESE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS THE BRAZILIAN SCIENTISTS CALL THEM FLYING RIVERS AND THEY FUNNEL ALL OF THAT EXTRA WATER VAPOR OVER THE LAND WHERE STORM CONDITIONS TRIGGER THESE MASSIVE RECORD BREAKING DOWNPOURS THIS IS FROM MONTANA TAKE A LOOK AT THIS STORM LAST AUGUST AS IT MOVES OVER TUCSON ARIZONA IT LITERALLY SPLASHES OFF THE CITY THESE DOWNPOURS ARE REALLY UNUSUAL LAST JULY IN HOUSTON TEXAS IT RAINED FOR TWO DAYS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO BILLION GALLONS THAT REPRESENTS MORE THAN TWO DAYS OF THE FULL FLOW OF NIAGARA FALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY WHICH WAS OF COURSE PARALYZED THESE RECORD DOWNPOURS ARE CREATING HISTORIC FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES THIS ONE IS FROM CHILE LAST YEAR AND YOU'LL SEE THAT WAREHOUSE GOING BY THERE ARE OIL TANKERS CARS GOING BY THIS IS FROM SPAIN LAST SEPTEMBER YOU COULD CALL THIS THE RUNNING OF THE CARS AND TRUCKS I GUESS EVERY NIGHT ON THE TV NEWS NOW IS LIKE A NATURE HIKE THROUGH THE BOOK OF REVELATION I MEAN REALLY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS CERTAINLY NOTICED THE LOSSES HAVE BEEN MOUNTING UP THEY'RE NOT UNDER ANY ILLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE CAUSALITY REQUIRES A MOMENT OF DISCUSSION WE'RE USED TO THINKING OF LINEAR CAUSE AND LINEAR EFFECT ONE CAUSE ONE EFFECT THIS IS SYSTEMIC CAUSATION AS THE GREAT KEVIN TRENBERTH SAYS ALL STORMS ARE DIFFERENT NOW

LITTLE TOO COOL AND WE HAVE A BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BUT WHEN WOMEN IN SOME REGIONS OF SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA ARE ADVISED NOT TO GET PREGNANT FOR TWO YEARS THAT'S SOMETHING NEW THAT OUGHT TO GET OUR ATTENTION THE LANCET ONE OF THE TWO GREATEST MEDICAL JOURNALS IN THE WORLD LAST SUMMER LABELED THIS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY NOW AND THERE ARE MANY FACTORS BECAUSE OF IT THIS IS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE EXTINCTION CRISIS WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOSING FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL THE LIVING SPECIES ON EARTH BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY AND ALREADY LAND BASED PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE NOW MOVING TOWARDS THE POLES AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF FIFTEEN FEET PER DAY SPEAKING OF THE NORTH POLE LAST DECEMBER TWENTY NINE THE SAME STORM THAT CAUSED HISTORIC FLOODING IN THE AMERICAN MIDWEST RAISED TEMPERATURES AT THE NORTH POLE FIFTY DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WARMER THAN NORMAL CAUSING THE THAWING OF THE NORTH POLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LONG DARK WINTER POLAR NIGHT AND WHEN THE LAND BASED ICE OF THE ARCTIC MELTS IT RAISES SEA LEVEL PAUL NICKLEN'S BEAUTIFUL PHOTOGRAPH FROM SVALBARD ILLUSTRATES THIS IT'S MORE DANGEROUS COMING OFF GREENLAND AND PARTICULARLY ANTARCTICA THE TEN LARGEST RISK CITIES FOR SEA LEVEL RISE BY POPULATION ARE MOSTLY IN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA WHEN YOU MEASURE IT BY ASSETS AT RISK NUMBER ONE IS MIAMI THREE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS AT RISK NUMBER THREE NEW YORK AND NEWARK I WAS IN MIAMI LAST FALL DURING THE SUPERMOON ONE OF THE HIGHEST HIGH TIDE DAYS AND THERE WERE FISH FROM THE OCEAN SWIMMING IN SOME OF THE STREETS OF MIAMI BEACH AND FORT LAUDERDALE AND DEL REY AND THIS HAPPENS REGULARLY DURING THE HIGHEST TIDE TIDES NOW NOT WITH RAIN THEY CALL IT SUNNY DAY FLOODING IT COMES UP THROUGH THE STORM SEWERS AND THE MAYOR OF MIAMI SPEAKS FOR MANY WHEN HE SAYS IT IS LONG PAST TIME THIS CAN BE VIEWED THROUGH A PARTISAN LENS THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY WE HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND PARTISANSHIP AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HONOR THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO HAD THE COURAGE LAST FALL TO STEP OUT AND TAKE A POLITICAL RISK BY TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS SO THE COST OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS MOUNTING UP THERE ARE MANY OF THESE ASPECTS I HAVEN'T EVEN MENTIONED IT'S AN ENORMOUS BURDEN I'LL MENTION JUST ONE MORE BECAUSE THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM LAST MONTH IN DAVOS AFTER THEIR ANNUAL SURVEY OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ECONOMISTS SAID THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS NOW THE NUMBER ONE RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY SO YOU GET CENTRAL BANKERS LIKE MARK CARNEY THE HEAD OF THE UK CENTRAL BANK SAYING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CARBON RESERVES ARE UNBURNABLE SUBPRIME CARBON I'M NOT GOING TO REMIND YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH SUBPRIME MORTGAGES BUT IT'S THE SAME THING IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE CARBON FUELS THAT WERE BURNED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THIS IS THE QUANTITY BURNED IN THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS HERE ARE ALL THE ONES THAT ARE PROVEN AND LEFT ON THE BOOKS TWENTY EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY SAYS ONLY THIS AMOUNT CAN BE BURNED SO THE REST TWENTY TWO TRILLION DOLLARS UNBURNABLE RISK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT'S WHY DIVESTMENT MOVEMENT MAKES PRACTICAL SENSE AND IS NOT JUST A MORAL IMPERATIVE SO THE ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION MUST WE CHANGE IS YES WE HAVE TO CHANGE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE THIS IS THE EXCITING NEWS THE BEST PROJECTIONS IN THE WORLD SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WERE THAT BY TWENTY TEN THE WORLD WOULD BE ABLE TO INSTALL THIRTY GIGAWATTS OF WIND CAPACITY WE BEAT THAT MARK BY FOURTEEN AND A HALF TIMES OVER WE SEE AN EXPONENTIAL CURVE FOR WIND INSTALLATIONS NOW WE SEE THE COST COMING DOWN DRAMATICALLY SOME COUNTRIES TAKE GERMANY AN INDUSTRIAL POWERHOUSE WITH A CLIMATE NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM VANCOUVER'S BY THE WAY ONE DAY LAST DECEMBER GOT EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL ITS ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES MAINLY SOLAR AND WIND A LOT OF COUNTRIES ARE GETTING MORE THAN HALF ON AN AVERAGE BASIS MORE GOOD NEWS ENERGY STORAGE FROM BATTERIES PARTICULARLY IS NOW BEGINNING TO TAKE OFF BECAUSE THE COST HAS BEEN COMING DOWN VERY DRAMATICALLY TO SOLVE THE INTERMITTENCY PROBLEM WITH SOLAR THE NEWS IS EVEN MORE EXCITING THE BEST PROJECTIONS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO WERE THAT WE WOULD INSTALL ONE GIGAWATT PER YEAR BY TWENTY TEN WHEN TWENTY TEN CAME AROUND WE BEAT THAT MARK BY SEVENTEEN TIMES OVER LAST YEAR WE BEAT IT BY FIFTY EIGHT TIMES OVER THIS YEAR WE'RE ON TRACK TO BEAT IT SIXTY EIGHT TIMES OVER WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS WE ARE GOING TO PREVAIL THE EXPONENTIAL CURVE ON SOLAR IS EVEN STEEPER AND MORE DRAMATIC WHEN I CAME TO THIS STAGE TEN YEARS AGO THIS IS WHERE IT WAS WE HAVE SEEN A REVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH IN THE EMERGENCE OF THESE EXPONENTIAL CURVES AND THE COST HAS COME DOWN TEN PERCENT PER YEAR FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IT'S CONTINUING TO COME DOWN NOW THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS CERTAINLY NOTICED THIS BECAUSE IT'S CROSSING THE GRID PARITY POINT CHEAPER SOLAR PENETRATION RATES ARE BEGINNING TO RISE GRID PARITY IS UNDERSTOOD AS THAT LINE THAT THRESHOLD BELOW WHICH RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IS CHEAPER THAN ELECTRICITY FROM BURNING FOSSIL FUELS THAT THRESHOLD IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIRTY TWO DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND THIRTY THREE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OR ZERO AND ONE CELSIUS IT'S A DIFFERENCE OF MORE THAN ONE DEGREE IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ICE AND WATER AND IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARKETS THAT ARE FROZEN UP AND LIQUID FLOWS OF CAPITAL INTO NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT THIS IS THE BIGGEST NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND TWO THIRDS OF IT IS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE ARE SEEING AN EXPLOSION OF NEW INVESTMENT STARTING IN TWENTY TEN INVESTMENTS GLOBALLY IN RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATION SURPASSED FOSSILS THE GAP HAS BEEN GROWING EVER SINCE THE PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE ARE EVEN MORE DRAMATIC EVEN THOUGH FOSSIL ENERGY IS NOW STILL SUBSIDIZED AT A RATE FORTY TIMES LARGER THAN RENEWABLES AND BY THE WAY IF YOU ADD THE PROJECTIONS FOR NUCLEAR ON HERE PARTICULARLY IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE WORK MANY ARE DOING TO TRY TO BREAK THROUGH TO SAFER AND MORE ACCEPTABLE MORE AFFORDABLE FORMS OF NUCLEAR THIS COULD CHANGE EVEN MORE DRAMATICALLY SO IS THERE ANY PRECEDENT FOR SUCH A RAPID ADOPTION OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY WELL THERE ARE MANY BUT LET'S LOOK AT CELL PHONES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AT&AMPT THEN MA BELL COMMISSIONED MCKINSEY TO DO A GLOBAL MARKET SURVEY OF THOSE CLUNKY NEW MOBILE PHONES THAT APPEARED THEN HOW MANY CAN WE SELL BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND THEY ASKED MCKINSEY CAME BACK AND SAID NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND ARRIVED THEY DID SELL NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FIRST THREE DAYS AND FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR THEY SOLD ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TIMES MORE AND NOW THERE ARE MORE CELL CONNECTIONS THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD SO WHY WERE THEY NOT ONLY WRONG BUT WAY WRONG I'VE ASKED THAT QUESTION MYSELF WHY AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS IN THREE PARTS FIRST THE COST CAME DOWN MUCH FASTER THAN ANYBODY EXPECTED EVEN AS THE QUALITY WENT UP AND LOW INCOME COUNTRIES PLACES THAT DID NOT HAVE A LANDLINE GRID THEY LEAP FROGGED TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THE BIG EXPANSION HAS BEEN IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTIES SO WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY GRIDS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD WELL NOT SO HOT AND IN MANY AREAS THEY DON'T EXIST THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY ELECTRICITY AT ALL IN INDIA THAN THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO NOW WE'RE GETTING THIS SOLAR PANELS ON GRASS HUTS AND NEW BUSINESS MODELS THAT MAKE IT AFFORDABLE MUHAMMAD YUNUS FINANCED THIS ONE IN BANGLADESH WITH MICRO CREDIT THIS IS A VILLAGE MARKET BANGLADESH IS NOW THE FASTEST DEPLOYING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD TWO SYSTEMS PER MINUTE ON AVERAGE NIGHT AND DAY AND WE HAVE ALL WE NEED ENOUGH ENERGY FROM THE SUN COMES TO THE EARTH EVERY HOUR TO SUPPLY THE FULL WORLD'S ENERGY NEEDS FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN AN HOUR SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE IS CLEARLY YES AND IT'S AN EVER FIRMER YES LAST QUESTION WILL WE CHANGE PARIS REALLY WAS A BREAKTHROUGH SOME OF THE PROVISIONS ARE BINDING AND THE REGULAR REVIEWS WILL MATTER A LOT BUT NATIONS AREN'T WAITING THEY'RE GOING AHEAD CHINA HAS ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT STARTING NEXT YEAR THEY'RE ADOPTING A NATIONWIDE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM THEY WILL LIKELY LINK UP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THE UNITED STATES HAS ALREADY BEEN CHANGING ALL OF THESE COAL PLANTS WERE PROPOSED IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND CANCELED ALL OF THESE EXISTING COAL PLANTS WERE RETIRED ALL OF THESE COAL PLANTS HAVE HAD THEIR RETIREMENT ANNOUNCED ALL OF THEM CANCELED WE ARE MOVING FORWARD LAST YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE INVESTMENT IN NEW ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE UNITED STATES ALMOST THREE QUARTERS WAS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY MOSTLY WIND AND SOLAR WE ARE SOLVING THIS CRISIS THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET THERE SO IT MATTERS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ORGANIZING TO INSIST ON THIS CHANGE ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MARCHED IN NEW YORK CITY BEFORE THE UN SPECIAL SESSION ON THIS MANY THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS MARCHED IN CITIES AROUND THE WORLD AND SO I AM EXTREMELY OPTIMISTIC AS I SAID BEFORE WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS I'LL FINISH WITH THIS STORY WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD I HEARD THAT PROPOSAL BY PRESIDENT KENNEDY TO LAND A PERSON ON THE MOON AND BRING HIM BACK SAFELY IN TEN YEARS AND I HEARD ADULTS OF THAT DAY AND TIME SAY THAT'S RECKLESS EXPENSIVE MAY WELL FAIL BUT EIGHT YEARS AND TWO MONTHS LATER IN THE MOMENT THAT NEIL ARMSTRONG SET FOOT ON THE MOON THERE WAS GREAT CHEER THAT WENT UP IN NASA'S MISSION CONTROL IN HOUSTON HERE'S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT ABOUT THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERS THE CONTROLLERS IN THE ROOM THAT DAY WAS TWENTY SIX WHICH MEANS AMONG OTHER THINGS THEIR AGE WHEN THEY HEARD THAT CHALLENGE WAS EIGHTEEN WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE FACED ONE OF THE GREATEST POETS OF THE LAST CENTURY IN THE US WALLACE STEVENS WROTE A LINE THAT HAS STAYED WITH ME AFTER THE FINAL NO THERE COMES A YES AND ON THAT YES THE FUTURE WORLD DEPENDS WHEN THE ABOLITIONISTS STARTED THEIR MOVEMENT THEY MET WITH NO AFTER NO AFTER NO AND THEN CAME A YES THE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT MET ENDLESS NO'S UNTIL FINALLY THERE WAS A YES THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE MOVEMENT AGAINST APARTHEID AND MORE RECENTLY THE MOVEMENT FOR GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE AFTER THE FINAL NO COMES A YES WHEN ANY GREAT MORAL CHALLENGE IS ULTIMATELY RESOLVED INTO A BINARY CHOICE BETWEEN WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG THE OUTCOME IS FORE ORDAINED BECAUSE OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS NINETY NINE PERCENT OF US THAT IS WHERE WE ARE NOW AND IT IS WHY WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED SOME STILL DOUBT THAT WE HAVE THE WILL TO ACT BUT I SAY THE WILL TO ACT IS ITSELF A RENEWABLE RESOURCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'VE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE COMBINATION OF SKILLS YOU'VE GOT THIS SCIENTIST MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THE FULL RANGE OF ISSUES AND THE ABILITY TO TURN IT INTO THE MOST VIVID LANGUAGE NO ONE ELSE CAN DO THAT THAT'S WHY YOU LED THIS THING IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE IT TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE IT NOW WELL YOU'RE NICE TO SAY THAT CHRIS BUT HONESTLY I HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD FRIENDS IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WHO ARE INCREDIBLY PATIENT AND WHO WILL SIT THERE AND EXPLAIN THIS STUFF TO ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL I CAN GET IT INTO SIMPLE ENOUGH LANGUAGE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND THAT'S THE KEY TO TRYING TO COMMUNICATE SO YOUR TALK FIRST PART TERRIFYING SECOND PART INCREDIBLY HOPEFUL HOW DO WE KNOW THAT ALL THOSE GRAPHS ALL THAT PROGRESS IS ENOUGH TO SOLVE WHAT YOU SHOWED IN THE FIRST PART I THINK THAT THE CROSSING YOU KNOW I'VE ONLY BEEN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE INCUMBENT OR CHEAPER THAN TURNS OUT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF IT'S CHEAPER THAN AND WHEN IT CROSSES THAT LINE THEN A LOT OF THINGS REALLY CHANGE WE ARE REGULARLY SURPRISED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS THE LATE RUDI DORNBUSCH THE GREAT ECONOMIST SAID THINGS TAKE LONGER TO HAPPEN THEN YOU THINK THEY WILL AND THEN THEY HAPPEN MUCH FASTER THAN YOU THOUGHT THEY COULD I REALLY THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE USING THE PHRASE THE SOLAR SINGULARITY NOW MEANING WHEN IT GETS BELOW THE GRID PARITY UNSUBSIDIZED IN MOST PLACES THEN IT'S THE DEFAULT CHOICE NOW IN ONE OF THE PRESENTATIONS YESTERDAY THE JITNEY THING THERE IS AN EFFORT TO USE REGULATIONS TO SLOW THIS DOWN AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK THERE'S A WOMAN IN ATLANTA DEBBIE DOOLEY WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ATLANTA TEA PARTY THEY ENLISTED HER IN THIS EFFORT TO PUT A TAX ON SOLAR PANELS AND REGULATIONS AND SHE HAD JUST PUT SOLAR PANELS ON HER ROOF AND SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST AND SO SHE WENT AND FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND THEY FORMED A NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE GREEN TEA PARTY AND THEY DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL SO FINALLY THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THIS SOUNDS A LITTLE CORNY AND MAYBE IT'S A CLICHE BUT TEN YEARS AGO AND CHRISTIANA REFERRED TO THIS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE WHO PLAYED AN INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN GENERATING THOSE EXPONENTIAL CURVES AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT ECONOMICALLY FOR SOME OF THEM BUT IT KICK STARTED THIS GLOBAL REVOLUTION AND WHAT PEOPLE IN THIS AUDIENCE DO NOW WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS BUT IT MATTERS A LOT HOW FAST WE WIN IT AL GORE THAT WAS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE THE YEAR THAT THE PARTISAN THING CHANGES AS YOU SAID IT'S NO LONGER A PARTISAN ISSUE BUT YOU BRING ALONG PEOPLE FROM THE OTHER SIDE TOGETHER BACKED BY SCIENCE BACKED BY THESE KINDS OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES BACKED BY REASON THAT YOU WIN THE DAY BOY THAT'S REALLY EXCITING THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING ME BACK TO TED THANK YOU
