    'He, Sam Conway, was back from Mars now. Back from red, ferric deserts no Earthly boot had ever touched before. '
    'Back from bitter cold and aching dryness. Back from dazzling yellow hazes of dust and suspended ice crystals. No '
    'more need to wear oxygen armor in a thin, ozone tainted atmosphere now. Back from solitude, and the endless '
    'fight to keep alive out there. Back from the enigma of Martian civilizations extinction, uncounted ages ago.... '
    'Back, back, back....  Home, now! From the window Sam Conway could see a row of maples, orange and golden in the '
    'autumn warmth. Kids were playing football in the street. Sams oxy hydrogen rocket ship, blued and battered and '
    'burnt, was suspended for all time from massive girders in the Smithsonian Institution. But even that was far '
    'away from Bryton, here. It should have been finished, now—the adventure. Sam Conway should have relaxed. Even '
    'Ellen Varney was beside him now. That should have helped. It did, a little. Yet only for moments at a time.  '
    'Those twenty months of exploration on another world, had become like a phantom in Sams thoughts. Faded, distant, '
    'contrasting; yet starkly vivid too. Every hour had been a struggle. Extracting food substances from the tissues '
    'and juices of strange plants. Roasting native potassium chlorate in a small sun furnace to extract oxygen from '
    'it, and compressing the precious gas into steel flasks. All this had been necessary, the dying Martian '
    'atmosphere contained only a low percentage of oxygen.  It had been a strange hand to mouth existence out there—a '
    'kind of game in which a fellow tried always to keep one small jump ahead of Death.  Hauling a crude little metal '
    'wagon, in which his supplies were packed, across the sand for miles and miles at a time, until his brain had '
    'reeled. Sleeping in a tiny airtight tent, when afield from his rocket.... Sam had never expected to survive '
    'those experiences. But he had, somehow; and it had done something to his soul—hardened it, and maybe killed part '
    'of it; and maybe beautified another part. For in spite of everything, those vast, ghostly solitudes of Mars were '
    'beautiful—  And there was more. Climbing the steep wall of an ancient artificial gorge not far from the south '
    'polar cap; gripping at odd prickly vines to keep from falling into the hardy thickets below, where tough shelled '
    'worms crawled sluggishly, he had found something in a small, sand drifted cell that was part of a ruin. '
    'Something that meant power.  What kind of power? All kinds, perhaps. Scientific learning greater than that of '
    'Earth. Power like that of gold and jewels, but far exceeding it. Power to wreck and to create, power to destroy '
    'worlds. Power, maybe, to sway minds. Sam still could not guess how far it might extend, or how deep—  No the '
    'adventure was not over, yet. It was just beginning. It wasnt just nostalgia that tied the consciousness of Sam '
    'Conway to a planet, millions of miles away, whose people had perished in a strange travail ages ago—a '
    'catastrophe whose marks lay in fused, glassy ruins, and in machines melted and rusted beyond recognition.  Sam '
    'had that secret of power hidden away now in a little aluminum box that had once contained concentrated food '
    'rations. And having that secret—though it thrilled him—still made him wish nervously that he also had eyes in '
    'the back of his head....  Ellen Varneys slim fingers tightened on his arm.  "Sam!" she said almost sharply. '
    '"Youre dreaming again. What is it?"  He looked at her almost furtively, conscious of the familiar room around '
    'him, the old bookcase, the piano with a shaft of sunlight touching it gently; the radio and television cabinet. '
    'The colonial rag rugs, bright colored and homey....  Sam wondered wistfully if sometime soon his power would '
    'enable him to preserve in timeless youth the fragile beauty of Ellen Varney. Dark wavy hair, and an earnest face '
    'whose wisdom one could never forget. Maybe now even immortality would be possible.  Sam was nervous. Haste and '
    'preoccupation pressed him. But he put on a good show for the girls sake. The lines of worry dissolved around his '
    'grey, deep set eyes. He ran stubby fingers through his stiff mop of ash blond hair, and the tightness of his '
    'lips and jaw relaxed into a sheepish grin.  "Sure Im dreamin, Honey," he chuckled. "What man in my shoes '
    'wouldnt? Three years back I was nobody, working my way as a student engineer. Then Joe Nichols and his experts '
    'found out that my reflexes were better than those of anybody theyd tested. And that my brains and my emotional '
    'stability were okay. So pretty soon I was flying out there toward Mars—all for the glory of giving the Joe '
    'Nichols Food Products a publicity splurge. And now—well dont get the wrong idea of how I feel about it, '
    'Ellen—theyve made a big shot out of me. The newspapers, the radio, the scientists. Ive got a lot to do. I—you '
    'know!"  Ellen Varney was perhaps sure she did know. She smiled faintly, like the Mona Lisa smiling at the '
    'naïveté of men, and their little boy vanities. But there was a shadow of worry in her eyes, too.  "You wont stay '
    'here for supper, then, with the folks and me, Sam," she said wistfully. "Like old times...."  Sam couldnt think '
    'of anything nicer. But the pull of something else was much more strong.  "No, Honey," he said. "I—"  "Dont '
    'stumble, Sam," the girl returned. "Tomorrow night, then?"  "Maybe. I hope...."  He kissed her. A moment later he '
    'was out in the golden afternoon. He avoided the kids playing football out there in the street just as he used to '
    'play. He would have liked to talk to them. But—not now.  He climbed into his car. There he sat quietly for a '
    'moment, thinking. The autumn shadows, cast by the houses and trees, were long and blue. They reminded him of the '
    'shadows on Mars; and he felt a slight, not unpleasant, chill of loneliness and mystery plucking at his nerves. '
    'The sound of the wind wasnt so very different here either! Only out there it was shriller and much fainter and '
    'more sad, in the thin air, and through the muffling fabric of his oxygen suit.  Not so long ago Sam had seen '
    'those Martian winds shredding plumes of rusty red dust from the desert. Hed seen them blow balled masses of '
    'dried, prickly vegetation, like tumbleweeds, across the undulating red plain, and into the deep machine dug '
    'gorges, all but waterless now, that on Earth were called the "canals."  Hed seen those dried bundles of weeds '
    'collected in rows against the granite masonry of walls that were cold and crumbled in their ancientness but '
    'which looked fused along their low crests, like old lava, telling a story of violent and enigmatic calamity.  '
    'Thus Sam Conways reveries became unpleasant once more. He wanted to hurry again. He started the car, '
    'and drove swiftly out of the village. The tires crunched in dead leaves as he swung into the driveway that led '
    'down by the lake. Premonition must have been working in him, accentuating his caution and his haste.  There was '
    'a fair sized brick building there, an old garage. He unlocked the heavy door and went inside. The large main '
    'room of the structure was to be his laboratory; the office, his living quarters.  He surveyed the dingy interior '
    'critically. Everything, so far as he could see, was exactly as he had left it except for a small smear of ash on '
    'the floor in the office room. Driveway ash. Part of a mans footprint. His own? With the panic of a disturbed '
    'miser, Sam Conway thought back carefully. It could be his own footprint; but he couldnt remember—couldnt be '
    'sure!  His heart began to throb in mounting anxiety at the thought that the lair of his secret might have been '
    'entered during his absence. He pulled the shades carefully. Then he clawed his way through the clutter of '
    'paraphernalia in the little room—mostly boxes of new laboratory equipment, as yet unpacked. And a few glass jars '
    'containing plant samples, and specimens of odd Martian fauna—souvenirs he hadnt been required to turn over to '
    'the scientists.  He was sweating profusely from panic when he reached the carefully fitted mopboard in the '
    'corner after pulling aside a small desk. He pressed part of the wooden ornamentation, and a section of the '
    'mopboard turned on hinges. Feverishly he drew his precious aluminum box from the hiding place he had contrived, '
    'and unfastened its lid. From within came a reassuring, cryptic gleam; and Sam Conway almost wilted with relief.  '
    'But he wasnt satisfied yet. His fear of possible burglary wasnt the result of miserliness alone. He was afraid '
    'to have so gigantic a secret as he possessed get beyond himself—yet. And he was well aware that man would kill '
    'to own what he owned—and distrusted, withholding it from Nichols and his scientists.  Carefully he put the '
    'aluminum container back, and searched the premises. The windows. The doors. Everything. But he found no telltale '
    'marks of intrusion. The footprints, then, in the office room must have been his own. But hed bar the windows '
    'tomorrow. Hed put alarms on the entrances, and hed find a safer place for his aluminum box.  Now he prepared to '
    'work, getting his notebooks ready, putting a little collapsible table in the center of the office room, '
    'securing the heavy wood shutters of the windows, turning on the lights, and taking the aluminum box, '
    'which was his storehouse of miracles, once more from hiding.  As he sat down at the table, he placed a loaded '
    'pistol within easy reach at his elbow. Thus prepared, he lifted his treasure from its homely metal container, '
    'and set it lovingly before him. A cube, perhaps four inches square. Like glass. Almost crystal in its '
    'transparency, except for a dim misting of pearl. Crowning the cube was a metal pyramid, much tarnished with age, '
    'and a dial. That was all. But Sams gaze was almost gloating, as his mind filled with mighty visions of his own '
    'future. He was no different from any other man in this respect, for the touch of power was on him.  He turned '
    'the dial of the Martian apparatus. Within the cube spots of fire began to move, around and around a glowing '
    'center that was composed of myriad parts. It was all like a three dimensional cinema—illustrating, '
    'in this instance, some mystery of the atom—its revolving planetary electrons, its nucleus of neutrons, '
    'positrons....  In a strange eight fingered hand, which left the rest of its eon dead owners anatomy unpictured, '
    'a metal pointer was lifted, indicating this and that. It was like being in school on old Mars, whose people had '
    'been extinct for untold millions of years.... Maybe this apparatus, which held, in pictured, illustrated form, '
    'all the scientific lore of another time and world, had been a kind of school book.  Sam didnt understand much of '
    'this first lesson—yet. There were soft clinking noises—perhaps speech—which accompanied the fading, waxing, '
    'moving illustrations; but those music box notes were perhaps forever beyond him as far as meaning went.  The '
    'atomic structure views were replaced at last by pictures of machines and apparatus—and that was a little better. '
    'Before his eyes Sam saw complicated pieces of apparatus taken apart and reassembled. He saw complicated '
    'processes actually carried out step by step.  Sam Conways concentration was like a frozen hypnosis, '
    'and his brain was quick. But in the corners of the room there were faint shadows, and he was conscious of them. '
    'Still he took notes, and made drawings feverishly until the strain began to tell. Of course he could always '
    'refer back to the machine, repeating the views if necessary.  It was a month before he began to build. And then '
    'his first effort was only to produce a furnace and an alloy; the latter a product of the former. It was harder '
    'and more flexible than any steel yet produced. And it was worth money, providing the means to carry on his study '
    'and his work.  Work.... Sam seldom saw Ellen Varney now. He saw little of anybody. He told lies to be alone, '
    'and to continue his solitary efforts. His sense of struggle was like being on Mars again fighting for life, '
    'plodding through a thin feathery fall of snow there, in the dazing cold, close to the polar regions. And he '
    'dreamed of gigantic altruisms—the remaking of civilization.  In four months after his beginning, he had achieved '
    'things. Under a beam of specialized vibrations he saw a mouse do amazing tricks, its brain stimulated '
    'temporarily to an intelligence far beyond normal. It was awesome, and frightening too, watching that tiny animal '
    'turn—without error, and after it had been shown how only once—the complicated combination lock of a small door '
    'beyond which lay food.  Sam thrilled to the spectacle of the rodent laboring so keenly with its teeth and '
    'forepaws. What if the same waves were applied to the brain of a man? He would have tried those waves on himself, '
    'but his enthusiasm changed to dread when, with the removal of the beam, the mouse shuddered into a convulsion '
    'and died, its nervous system exhausted.  Biology revealed further mysteries and possibilities. In a glass flask, '
    'packed in a radioactive compound, and filled with water to which food substances had been added, Sam grew huge '
    'amoebae, whose ancestors had been microscopic. But these creatures were translucent globules, almost a quarter '
    'inch in diameter. Somewhere here, perhaps, lay hidden the secret of life itself. But the amoebae died of a '
    'strange disease, the germs of which were perhaps generated out of those same life processes.... To be sure of '
    'safety, Sam poured sulphuric acid into the culture flask.  He changed his direction now, back to the atom. Eight '
    'weeks more, and he was ready for another test. The main room of the old garage was crowded with apparatus. Then, '
    'one night, Sam closed a switch cautiously.  The result was not much different than the shorting of a high '
    'tension electric current across a broad arc. A snap. An avalanche of rattling blue flame, whose glare made '
    'everything look sharp and unreal. Then wires glowed to white heat and crumpled. A huge vacuum tube exploded into '
    'an incandescent puff of metallic vapors, superheated. The current was dead now—cut off. The experiment was a '
    'failure.  There were perhaps ten seconds like this—a sort of unsuspected bang—like that of a rifle cartridge '
    'whose defective primer cap fails to ignite the powder immediately when the firing pin strikes it. The garage '
    'interior was still illuminated, for the lights were on a different circuit. Smoke was blue along the raftered '
    'roof, and the red glow had faded from heated metal.  Then, at a moment beyond all expectation, a searing glare '
    'leaped out from between two close pressed copper electrodes which had been the center of Sams experiment. A wave '
    'of rays and heat, and stunning electrical emanations. Sam Conways mind was far too slow for him to grasp just '
    'what happened. He only remembered a little when, battered and scorched, he picked himself up from the concrete '
    'pavement after a minute or more.  The points of the electrodes were shattered, but they still glared, '
    'incandescent, providing the only light now, for the light bulbs were shattered. Staring from aching, '
    'ray reddened eyes, Sam saw only that glow, for he was temporarily all but blinded. But there were little pits in '
    'that hot copper—pits out of which the metal must have literally exploded.'
